<p class="p2">For the design of the <b>Velotracker 9000</b> our specialist seeked inspiration at popular and
well known "Zn√ºnibox". It brings a little bit of the swiss german culture into our product, where the idea of
the <b>Velotracker 9000</b> was born. However, it fits perfectly to every bike and is rarely recognized, which
makes it the perfect safety gadget for your bike. Its simple and clean design does not disturb the over all look
of your bike and for bikes with a carrier, the delivery includes an additional set to hide it beneath the
carrier. As this is the perfect spot, it is nearly impossible to see it. Now thief will find it.  </p>
